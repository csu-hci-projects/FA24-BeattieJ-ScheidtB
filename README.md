## Responsibilities
### Brendan Scheidt
- Integrated health mechanic into ```BP_target```.
- Created health bar widget for targets
- Created new objects that damage the player (```BP_HurtingObject2```, ```BP_KillBox```, ```BP_Spikes```)
- Created second level (obstacle course style-map).
### James Beattie Jr.
- Created UI (User Interface) which displays ammo count, # of targets, and the health bar. All of which dynamically update as player progresses through game. 
- Created logic for ammo/ammo pick ups for the weapon component.
- Created first level (small-town map). 
- Created logic for targets to disappear once they lose all health.
### Tasks Brendan & James worked on together
- Created health logic for player, including logic for how the player takes damage from the rotating objects, and how the player can replenish health from health pickups scattered around the map.
