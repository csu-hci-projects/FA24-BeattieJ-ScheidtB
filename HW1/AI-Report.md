## Overview
Below, is a preview of how we used LLMs (e.g.. ChatGPT) to help complete HW1:

All LLM help was completed with the ChatGPT 4o model throughout one chat log. We would ask it how to complete a task within the engine from a high-level view, and it would give steps on creating the blueprint or instantiating objects correctly within the editor. With the blueprint help, it would tell us which components to add and where their pins should connect to. We noticed that the model didn't have a great understanding of the version of UE5 that we were working on and sometimes would suggest components or pin connections that weren't available in our version, so we had to work out the logic ourselves or consult the documentation. We also presented the model with bugs we were running into, and it would suggest workarounds or solutions. We also asked for additional clarification about implementations it suggested to get a better idea of how to move forward. We just mainly needed help implementing the health bar for the targets and having them displayed in the 3D world by following the targets. Below is the entire conversation we had with the 4o model:

## Chat Log

**You:**

I am developing a game in UE5.3. I currently have a health variable on my player blueprint. I need to make it so that if that variable is ever <= 0, my player dies and you need to restart the current level over

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To implement this in Unreal Engine 5.3, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Health Variable in Your Player Blueprint:**
    
    * Ensure you have a float variable named `Health` in your player blueprint, representing the player's health.
2. **Create a Function to Handle Player Death:**
    
    * In your player blueprint, create a custom event called something like `HandleDeath`.
    * Inside this event, you can reset the player, display a death animation, or trigger any other death-related effects.
3. **Check Health Value:**
    
    * In the `Event Tick` or whenever the player takes damage (such as during a combat event), add a branch node that checks if `Health <= 0`.
    * If true, call the `HandleDeath` event.
4. **Restart the Level:**
    
    * After calling the `HandleDeath` event, add a node to restart the level. You can do this by using the `Open Level` node:
        * Drag off from the event node, search for `Open Level`, and connect it.
        * For the level name, you can use `Get Current Level Name` to restart the same level.

Here’s an example logic breakdown for clarity:

* On the player taking damage, you reduce the `Health` variable.
* Use a branch node to check `Health <= 0`.
* If true, call a custom event (e.g., `HandleDeath`) to reset or animate the player’s death.
* After the death event, use the `Open Level` node to restart the current level.

Would you like me to clarify any specific part of this process?

* * *

**You:**

okay I am very new... How do i create a new event and what do I need to do step by step

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

No worries! I’ll walk you through the process step by step, assuming you're using Unreal Engine 5.3's Blueprint system.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Player Death Event in Unreal Engine 5.3

#### Step 1: Open Your Player Blueprint

1. In the Unreal Editor, go to the **Content Browser**.
2. Find your **Player Blueprint** (usually named something like `BP_Player` or whatever you’ve named it).
3. Double-click to open it.

#### Step 2: Add the Health Variable

1. In the Player Blueprint, go to the **My Blueprint** panel on the left.
2. Click the **+** button next to **Variables**.
3. Name the new variable `Health`.
4. In the **Details** panel (usually on the right), change the **Variable Type** to `Float` (as health typically has a numeric value that can go below 0).
5. Set an initial value for your `Health`, like `100`, under **Default Value** in the Details panel.

#### Step 3: Create the HandleDeath Custom Event

1. In the **Event Graph** (the big space in the middle of the blueprint), right-click and search for "Custom Event."
2. Select **Add Custom Event** from the search results.
3. Name the custom event `HandleDeath`.

This is the event that will handle what happens when the player dies.

#### Step 4: Implement the Player Death Logic (Restarting the Level)

1. Right-click again in the **Event Graph** and search for `Open Level`.
2. Click on **Open Level** to add the node.
3. Connect the `HandleDeath` event to the `Open Level` node.
4. In the **Open Level** node, you’ll need to enter the name of the current level (or leave it dynamic by using `Get Current Level Name` if you’re unsure).

You now have the basic event to restart the level when the player dies.

#### Step 5: Check Health Value Every Time Damage Occurs

1. If you already have a system where the player can take damage, you should hook this next part into that system (like when the player is hit by an enemy).
    * If you don't have that yet, you can test by doing it in the `Event Tick` temporarily:
        1. Right-click in the Event Graph and add an **Event Tick** node (this runs every frame).
2. Off the `Event Tick` node (or your damage system), drag off and search for your `Health` variable.
3. Drag a pin from `Health` and add a **<= (float)** node.
4. Set the value to `0` (so it checks if health is less than or equal to 0).
5. Drag off the result of the **<=** node and add a **Branch** node.
6. Connect the **Branch** node back to your event or tick event.
7. From the **True** output of the **Branch**, connect it to your `HandleDeath` custom event.

This setup checks the player’s health, and if it’s `<= 0`, it will trigger the `HandleDeath` event, restarting the level.

#### Step 6: Test Your Setup

1. Click **Compile** in the top left of the Blueprint editor.
2. Save your Blueprint.
3. Press **Play** in the Unreal Editor to test it.

When the player’s health reaches zero, the level should now restart.

### Summary of the Blueprint Nodes:

* **Event Tick** or another event (like damage).
* **Health <= 0** (Branch check).
* **Custom Event: HandleDeath**.
* **Open Level** (restart current level).

Would you like more details on adding specific damage systems or any other parts?

* * *

**You:**

So, when the health gits below 0, I print a string saying dead after calling HandleDeath, but the level doesn't reload but I do see the printed string. the level name is "Untitled", is there a better way to make sure the level reloads?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If you're seeing the debug string but the level isn't reloading, it sounds like the `Open Level` node isn't being triggered correctly. Here's how you can troubleshoot and ensure the level reloads:

### Step-by-Step to Fix Level Reload:

#### 1. Use the Correct Level Name:

* **Level Name:** In the `Open Level` node, you need to ensure the level name matches exactly.
    * In your case, the level name is `"Untitled"`. Make sure you type it exactly as it is in the `Open Level` node's `Level Name` field.
    * Be careful with case sensitivity and avoid any extra spaces or characters.

#### 2. Debug the Level Name:

* To confirm you're using the correct name, you can temporarily print the level name.
    * Add a `Print String` node before the `Open Level` node and type `"Untitled"` as the message to ensure you're using the right level name.

#### 3. Use `Get Current Level Name` (Safer Option):

* A more dynamic way to ensure the level reloads is to use the current level name directly.
    * Right-click in the graph and search for `Get Current Level Name`.
    * Drag from the `Return Value` pin of `Get Current Level Name` and connect it to the `Open Level` node’s `Level Name` input. This way, the level reloads automatically no matter the name.

Here’s how to wire it:

1. Add the `Get Current Level Name` node.
2. Drag the output (the level name) from `Get Current Level Name` into the `Level Name` input of `Open Level`.

This ensures that whatever level you're in gets reloaded dynamically.

#### 4. Check for Any Open Doors or UI

* If you have UI elements or other mechanics (like open menus or paused game states), it could be blocking the level reload. Ensure that nothing is preventing the game from calling the `Open Level` node.

#### 5. Recheck Event Order:

* Make sure `HandleDeath` is being called correctly, and `Open Level` comes after it.
* You can temporarily remove or comment out any other nodes and just have `HandleDeath` immediately call `Open Level` to see if the reload works in isolation.

Let me know if you'd like more help with debugging this!

**You:**

Okay, now I have targets that need to have health. currently they get destroyed if they collide with BP_first_person_projectile, but I need to have each projectile take away its health variable instead. Only when its health is <= 0 does it get destroyed. I also need to display a healthbar above its head. Currently I have a healthbar for the player as a blueprint, but I need each of these targets to have their own healthbar too

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To give each target its own health system, allow projectiles to reduce health, and display a health bar above the targets, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Health Variable for the Target

1. **Open the Target Blueprint:**
    
    * Go to your **Content Browser** and find the Blueprint for your target (e.g., `BP_Target`).
    * Open it.
2. **Add the Health Variable:**
    
    * In the **My Blueprint** panel on the left, click the **+** next to Variables.
    * Name it `Health`, and set the type to `Float`.
    * Give it an initial value (e.g., `100`).

### Step 2: Modify the Projectile to Reduce Health

1. **Open the Projectile Blueprint:**
    
    * Go to the **Content Browser** and open your projectile blueprint (`BP_First_Person_Projectile` or similar).
2. **Modify the Collision Event:**
    
    * In the **Event Graph** of the projectile, find the logic where it destroys the target.
    * Instead of destroying the target on hit, you'll reduce its health:
        * Drag off from the "Other Actor" pin (which refers to the target) and use a **Cast To [Target Blueprint]** node (replace `[Target Blueprint]` with your actual target’s class).
        * From the target cast, drag out and get the `Health` variable.
        * Subtract the damage amount (e.g., `-10`).
        * Set the new value back to the target’s `Health` variable using a **Set Health** node.
        * Add a **Branch** node to check if the `Health` is `<= 0`.
        * If true, use the **Destroy Actor** node to destroy the target.

Here’s the flow:

* On collision → Cast to target → Get Health → Subtract damage → Set Health → Check if Health <= 0 → If true, Destroy Actor.

### Step 3: Add a Health Bar Above the Target

1. **Create a New Health Bar Widget:**
    
    * In the **Content Browser**, right-click and go to **User Interface > Widget Blueprint**.
    * Name it something like `WB_HealthBar_Target`.
2. **Design the Health Bar:**
    
    * Open the `WB_HealthBar_Target` widget.
    * Add a **Progress Bar** (you can find it in the palette on the left).
    * Set the progress bar to `Fill` and style it how you like (change color, size, etc.).
    * Bind the progress value to the target’s `Health` variable (we will set this up in the next step).
3. **Add the Health Bar to the Target:**
    
    * Go back to your target blueprint (`BP_Target`).
    * Add a **Widget Component** to your target (this is the 3D representation of the widget).
        * In the **Components** panel, click **Add Component** and choose **Widget**.
        * In the details of the Widget Component, under **User Widget Class**, select your `WB_HealthBar_Target` widget.
        * Adjust the position of the widget (move it above the target's head).
4. **Bind the Health Bar to the Target’s Health:**
    
    * In the **WB_HealthBar_Target** widget, bind the **Progress Bar** value to the target’s `Health`:
        * In the widget's graph, create a **Binding** for the progress bar's `Percent` value.
        * Cast to the target (similar to what you did with the projectile) and get the current `Health`.
        * Divide the current `Health` by the target's **Max Health** (e.g., `Health / 100`), and return that as the progress bar’s value (so it updates between 0.0 and 1.0).

### Step 4: Display the Health Bar

1. **Face the Player:**
    
    * Make sure the health bar is always facing the player by checking the **Widget Component** settings.
        * In the details of the widget component, enable **Screen Space** for the `Space` setting. This makes sure the health bar stays visible and oriented toward the camera.
2. **Update the Health Bar in Real-Time:**
    
    * Every time you reduce the target’s health, the health bar will update automatically since it’s bound to the `Health` variable.

### Testing the System

* **Compile** and **Save** your Blueprints.
* Test by shooting a target and see if the health bar updates as projectiles reduce the target's health, and if the target is destroyed when health reaches `0`.

Would you like further clarification on any of the steps?

* * *

**You:**

Okay I have the logic working for a target's health, and I already have a healthbar widget that is displayed over the entire screen for the player's health. How do I use this widget ti display the targets health?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great! Since you already have a health bar widget for the player, you can reuse or modify that widget for displaying each target’s health over their heads. Here's how to adapt your existing widget to show the target’s health:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Duplicate or Modify the Existing Health Bar Widget

1. **Find the Player Health Widget** in the **Content Browser**.
2. **Duplicate** it (right-click on it and choose **Duplicate**).
    * Name the duplicated widget something like `WB_HealthBar_Target` to avoid confusion with the player's health bar.If you don't want to duplicate it and instead want to reuse the same widget for both the player and targets, skip this step.

#### Step 2: Modify the Target Health Bar Widget

1. **Open `WB_HealthBar_Target`** (or the duplicated version of your player’s health bar).
    
2. **Adjust the Size**:
    
    * Since the target's health bar will be displayed above its head and not as a full-screen widget, resize the health bar to a smaller size (in the Designer view).
    * Adjust its size and position to suit how you want it to look above each target's head.
3. **Bind the Progress Bar**:
    
    * Go to the progress bar in your widget.
    * In the **Details Panel**, scroll to **Percent**, and click **Bind**.
    * Create a new binding function that will return the target's health as a percentage.
4. **Get the Target's Health** in the Binding Function:
    
    * In the new binding function, you need to cast to the target blueprint (just like you did in your projectile damage logic).
        * Drag from the `Try Get Pawn Owner` node (if it's available), and use a **Cast To [Target Blueprint]** node to access the target’s health variable.
        * Retrieve the target’s `Health` variable and divide it by its maximum health (e.g., `Health / 100` if the max health is 100).
        * Return this value as the output of the binding function (it should be a value between 0 and 1 to represent the fill percentage of the progress bar).

#### Step 3: Add the Widget to the Target Blueprint

1. **Open the Target Blueprint** (e.g., `BP_Target`).
    
2. **Add a Widget Component**:
    
    * In the **Components** section, click **Add Component** and choose **Widget**.
    * Rename it `HealthBarWidget`.
    * In the **Details Panel**, set the **User Widget Class** to `WB_HealthBar_Target` (or the widget you modified for the target’s health).
3. **Position the Health Bar**:
    
    * Adjust the widget’s **Location** to be above the target’s head (e.g., raise the `Z` axis to place it above the target).
4. **Set the Widget to Screen Space**:
    
    * In the widget component’s details, find the **Space** setting and change it to **Screen**.
        * This makes the widget always face the camera and appear above the target.

#### Step 4: Update the Health Bar Dynamically

* Since the progress bar is bound to the target’s `Health` variable, it will automatically update as the health changes when projectiles hit the target.

#### Step 5: Testing the Health Bar

1. **Compile** and **Save** your changes.
2. **Play** the game and test by shooting the targets. The health bar should appear above each target, and it should decrease as the target’s health is reduced by the projectiles.

### Summary

* You reused or duplicated the player’s health bar widget.
* You bound the widget’s progress bar to the target’s health.
* You added the widget to the target blueprint, positioned it above the target, and made it screen-facing.

Let me know if you need further assistance with any of these steps!

* * *

**You:**

I need more in depth steps on step 2-4 and step 3 entirely

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Let’s break down **Step 2-4** and **Step 3** more thoroughly to ensure everything is clear. This will guide you through binding the health bar to the target's health and setting it up in the blueprint.

### Step 2: Modify the Target Health Bar Widget

#### Step 2.1: Open the `WB_HealthBar_Target` Widget

* Open the widget you either duplicated from the player's health bar or created for the target’s health bar (e.g., `WB_HealthBar_Target`).

#### Step 2.2: Adjust the Size of the Widget

* In the **Designer** view, click on the **Progress Bar** (the bar showing the health).
* In the **Details** panel on the right:
    * Under the **Size** section, you can adjust the width and height of the health bar to something smaller (e.g., width 200, height 20) since it will appear above the target’s head.
    * You can also customize the colors or style if needed.

#### Step 2.3: Bind the Progress Bar to the Target's Health

* Now, we’ll bind the progress bar to reflect the target's health dynamically.

1. **Select the Progress Bar** in the Designer view.
2. In the **Details** panel on the right, find the **Percent** property (this controls how much of the bar is filled).
3. **Click the Bind button** (next to Percent).
    * A drop-down will appear, select **Create Binding**.
    * This will open the **Graph View** and create a function that controls how the health bar updates.

#### Step 2.4: Create the Binding Logic to Reflect Target's Health

1. In the binding function that was automatically created, you’ll need to return the percentage of health left on the target (i.e., between 0.0 and 1.0).
    
2. **Access the Target’s Health:**
    
    * First, drag off from the **Return Node** in the graph.
    * **Right-click** and search for **Try Get Pawn Owner**. This node tries to get the owning actor (in this case, the target the widget is attached to).
    * From the output of `Try Get Pawn Owner`, **drag off** and search for **Cast To [Target Blueprint]**. Replace `[Target Blueprint]` with the name of the target blueprint you’re using (e.g., `BP_Target`).
    * Now you can access the health variable of the target:
        * From the target cast, **drag off** and search for **Get Health** (assuming you named the health variable `Health` in your target blueprint).
3. **Calculate the Health Percentage:**
    
    * To turn the health into a percentage, divide it by the target’s maximum health.
    * Drag off the `Get Health` pin and search for the **Float / Float** node.
    * On the second input of the division, enter the target’s maximum health (e.g., `100` if the health is out of 100).
4. **Return the Health Percentage:**
    
    * Drag the output of the division into the **Return Node**.
    * The result is a value between 0 and 1 that represents the percentage of the target's health left.
5. **Compile and Save** the widget.
    

### Step 3: Add the Widget to the Target Blueprint

#### Step 3.1: Add a Widget Component to the Target

1. **Open the Target Blueprint** (`BP_Target` or your target class).
2. In the **Components** panel (on the left), click **Add Component** and choose **Widget**.
3. **Rename** the widget component to something like `HealthBarWidget` (just to keep things clear).

#### Step 3.2: Set the Widget Class to Your Health Bar Widget

1. In the **Details** panel of the widget component (on the right), find the **User Widget Class** field.
2. Click the drop-down and choose `WB_HealthBar_Target` (or whatever you named the widget you created for the target health).

#### Step 3.3: Adjust the Widget Position

1. You’ll want the health bar to appear above the target’s head. To do this:
    * Select the widget component.
    * In the **Transform** section of the **Details** panel, adjust the `Location` values, particularly the `Z` value, to move the widget upward. For example, try increasing `Z` to 100 or higher depending on the size of the target.This moves the widget above the target’s head.

#### Step 3.4: Make the Widget Always Face the Player (Screen Space)

1. In the **Details** panel for the widget component, find the **Space** setting.
2. Change **Space** from **World** to **Screen**.
    * This ensures that the health bar is always oriented toward the camera, making it easier for the player to see.

#### Step 3.5: Link the Widget to Update the Target's Health

1. Now that the widget is added to the target blueprint, it will automatically update because the progress bar is bound to the target’s health variable.
2. As the health decreases (from the logic you set up with the projectile), the health bar above the target’s head will dynamically reflect the health value.

### Final Steps

1. **Compile and Save** the Target Blueprint.
2. **Playtest** your game to make sure that:
    * The health bar appears above the target’s head.
    * The health bar decreases as projectiles hit the target.
    * The target is destroyed when the health reaches 0.

* * *

### Troubleshooting Tips

* If the health bar isn’t updating:
    * Double-check that the health bar’s **Percent** binding is working correctly and that it's returning the health as a percentage.
    * Ensure the health variable is being reduced properly in the target blueprint when hit by the projectile.

Let me know if you run into any issues or need more help!

**You:**

this is the node setup I have for the player health. I don't understand how to have this be for the target health instead (which is an actor):




* * *

**ChatGPT:**

I see your current setup is getting the player character's health. To adapt this for the target’s health, we need to make a few changes. Here’s how to modify this node setup for the target, which is an actor instead of a player character:

### Steps to Modify the Node Setup for Target's Health

1. **Remove the "Get Player Character" Node**:
    
    * The target is not the player, so we don’t need to use `Get Player Character`. You’ll remove that node entirely.
2. **Replace "Cast to BP_FirstPersonCharacter" with a Cast to Your Target's Class**:
    
    * You need to cast to the specific class of your target (e.g., `Cast To BP_Target`, or whatever your target blueprint is called).
    * Right-click on the graph, search for **Cast to [Target's Class]**, and connect it where the player cast was.
    
    Here's how you connect it:
    
    * The **Object** input pin of the cast should be connected to a **Try Get Pawn Owner** node, if you're setting this up inside the health bar widget for the target.
3. **Access the Target's Health Variable**:
    
    * After successfully casting to the target class, drag off from the "As BP_Target" pin.
    * Search for and select **Get Health** (assuming your target blueprint has a float variable named `Health`).
    * This will access the target’s health.
4. **Calculate the Health Percentage**:
    
    * Just like in your current setup, divide the target’s `Health` by its maximum health (e.g., 100).
    * Use a **Float / Float** division node.
    * Connect the result to the **Return Node**.

### Updated Node Breakdown:

* **Try Get Pawn Owner**: This node tries to get the owner of the widget (the target actor).
* **Cast to BP_Target**: Cast to your target's blueprint class.
* **Get Health**: Access the health variable from the target.
* **Float / Float**: Divide the current health by the maximum health (e.g., 100).
* **Return Node**: Returns the percentage (a value between 0 and 1) to the progress bar.

### Example:

```plaintext
Try Get Pawn Owner → Cast to BP_Target → Get Health → Divide by 100 → Return Node
```

Would you like me to provide further clarification on any step, or need help setting up this exact node chain?

* * *

**You:**

try get pawn owner is not a node option

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Thanks for the clarification! Since you're working with an actor (target) rather than a character, and it sounds like you're setting this up in a widget that might not directly be a component of the target, we’ll need to adjust the approach.

Instead of using `Try Get Pawn Owner`, we’ll directly reference the target that the widget is attached to.

### Updated Approach:

#### 1. Use "Get Owning Actor" Instead of "Try Get Pawn Owner":

* **Get Owning Actor** is available for widgets that are attached to actors. Since your health bar widget is attached to the target actor (via the widget component), this will get the actor that owns the widget.

Here’s how to do it:

1. **Delete** the `Get Player Character` node.
2. **Right-click** in the graph and search for **Get Owning Actor**.
    * This node will return the actor that owns the widget (in this case, the target).

#### 2. Cast the Owning Actor to Your Target Blueprint Class:

* **Drag off** from the **Get Owning Actor** node and search for **Cast to [Target Blueprint]** (replace `[Target Blueprint]` with your specific target class, such as `Cast to BP_Target`).

#### 3. Access the Target’s Health:

* **Drag off** from the output of the successful cast (the "As BP_Target" pin).
* Search for **Get Health** to retrieve the target’s health value.

#### 4. Calculate the Health Percentage:

* Divide the health value by the target’s maximum health (e.g., 100).
* Use a **Float / Float** division node and return that value to the **Return Node**.

### Node Setup:

* **Get Owning Actor** → **Cast to BP_Target** → **Get Health** → **Divide by 100** → **Return Node**.

This will allow the widget to dynamically track and display the target’s health.

Would you like further clarification on this, or help with any part of the node setup?

* * *

**You:**

yea that doesnt work either, get owning actor says "the blueprint (self) is not an AnimInstance. Therefore 'Target' must have a connection" when compiling

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Ah, I see the issue now! Since the widget component is part of the target actor, we need a direct connection to the target from the widget's context. Let's use a more reliable method to link the target to its health bar.

### Here's how to fix the issue:

### Step 1: Pass the Target Actor to the Widget

We need to give the widget a reference to its owning actor when it's created in the target blueprint. This way, the widget can directly access the target's health.

#### 1.1 Create a Variable for the Target in Your Widget Blueprint:

1. **Open** the `WB_HealthBar_Target` widget (the one that displays the health bar for the target).
2. In the **My Blueprint** panel on the left, under **Variables**, click the **+** button to create a new variable.
3. **Name it** `OwningActor` or `TargetActor`.
4. **Set the type** of this variable to **Actor** (since the target is an actor).

#### 1.2 Expose the Variable to Allow External Access:

1. In the Details panel for the `OwningActor` variable, check **"Instance Editable"** and **"Expose on Spawn"**.
    * This allows you to set the target actor when you create the widget in the target blueprint.

#### Step 2: Set the `OwningActor` Variable in the Target Blueprint

We need to set the `OwningActor` variable in the widget when the widget is added to the target blueprint.

#### 2.1 Go to the Target Blueprint (`BP_Target`):

1. Open the target blueprint.
2. Find the part where you **add the widget** to the target (this is likely in the `BeginPlay` event if you're adding it when the game starts).

#### 2.2 Set the `OwningActor` for the Widget:

1. After creating the widget (using **Create Widget** or in the **Widget Component** setup), drag off the return value of the widget creation.
2. Search for **Set OwningActor** (this is the variable you created in the widget).
3. For the value of **OwningActor**, use **Self** (this refers to the current target actor).
    * This tells the widget which actor it's attached to.

### Step 3: Update the Binding in the Widget

Now that the widget knows which actor it belongs to, we can update the health bar binding to pull the target's health directly.

#### 3.1 Go Back to the `WB_HealthBar_Target` Widget:

1. In the **Get Percent** function (the function bound to the progress bar's percentage), drag off from the `OwningActor` variable.
2. **Cast** it to the target blueprint class (e.g., `Cast To BP_Target`).
3. Once the cast is successful, drag off from the "As BP_Target" pin and **Get Health**.
4. Divide the health by the target's maximum health (e.g., 100) and return that value.

### Updated Node Flow:

1. **OwningActor** (variable in the widget) → **Cast to BP_Target** → **Get Health** → **Divide by 100** → **Return Node**.

### Final Steps:

* **Compile and Save** the changes in both the widget and target blueprints.
* Test in-game to make sure the health bar updates as the target takes damage.

**You:**

okay I dont have the widget displaying in the bp_target class yet either, how do I do that and set up the owning actor

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

No worries! Let me walk you through the entire process of:

1. Adding the health bar widget to the target actor (`BP_Target`).
2. Setting the `OwningActor` reference so the widget knows which target actor it belongs to.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Add the Widget and Set Up the Owning Actor

#### Step 1: Add a Widget Component to the Target Actor

1. **Open the Target Blueprint** (`BP_Target`):
    
    * Go to your `BP_Target` actor in the **Content Browser** and open it in the Blueprint Editor.
2. **Add a Widget Component**:
    
    * In the **Components** panel on the left side of the Blueprint Editor, click **Add Component**.
    * Search for **Widget** and select **Widget Component**.
    * This will attach a widget to your target actor.
3. **Set the Widget Class**:
    
    * With the new Widget Component selected, go to the **Details** panel on the right.
    * Under **User Interface > Widget Class**, choose your health bar widget (`WB_HealthBar_Target` or whatever you named it).
4. **Position the Widget**:
    
    * In the **Details** panel, adjust the **Location** to position the widget above the target’s head.
    * For example, you may increase the `Z` value to move it above the actor (e.g., `Z = 100`).

#### Step 2: Pass the Target Actor to the Widget

Now that the widget is attached to the target, you need to pass the target actor to the widget so it can access the target’s health.

1. **Expose the Target Actor in the Widget**:
    
    * Open your widget blueprint (`WB_HealthBar_Target`).
    * In the **My Blueprint** panel on the left, create a new variable by clicking the **+** button.
    * Name the variable `OwningActor` (or `TargetActor`).
    * Set its type to **Actor** (or whatever class your target actor is, like `BP_Target` if you want to be specific).
2. **Expose on Spawn**:
    
    * In the Details panel of the `OwningActor` variable, check **"Instance Editable"** and **"Expose on Spawn"**.
    * This allows the target actor to set itself as the owning actor when the widget is created.
3. **Set the Owning Actor in the Target Blueprint**:
    
    * Go back to your target blueprint (`BP_Target`).
    * In the **Event Graph**, find the place where you want to initialize the widget (you could use the **BeginPlay** event for this).
    * **Drag the Widget Component** (the one you added in Step 1) into the graph.
    * Use a **Get User Widget Object** node to access the widget.
4. **Set the Owning Actor**:
    
    * From the output of **Get User Widget Object**, drag out and search for **Set OwningActor** (this is the variable you exposed in the widget).
    * Connect it to the widget.
    * For the value of `OwningActor`, drag out from the blueprint’s **Self** node and connect it (this sets the current target actor as the owning actor).

#### Step 3: Update the Health Bar's Percent Binding

1. **Open the Health Bar Widget**:
    
    * Go back to the `WB_HealthBar_Target` widget.
2. **Modify the Health Binding**:
    
    * In the widget’s Graph, find the binding for the health bar’s **Percent** (the function that controls how much of the bar is filled).
    * Drag out from the `OwningActor` variable.
    * Cast it to your target actor class (e.g., `Cast To BP_Target`).
    * From the cast’s output, **Get Health**.
    * Divide the `Health` by the target's maximum health (e.g., 100) and connect the result to the **Return Node**.

### Step 4: Compile and Test

1. **Compile and Save** both the widget blueprint (`WB_HealthBar_Target`) and the target blueprint (`BP_Target`).
2. Test your game:
    * When you play the game, the health bar should now appear above each target's head.
    * The health bar should dynamically update as the target takes damage.

### Summary of What We Did:

1. **Added a Widget Component** to the target actor (`BP_Target`).
2. **Set the Widget Class** to the health bar widget.
3. **Passed the Target Actor** as `OwningActor` to the widget using the `Set OwningActor` node.
4. **Bound the Health Bar** in the widget to the target’s health variable.

This setup ensures that each target has its own health bar, and the health bar updates when the target’s health changes.

Let me know if you need more specific instructions or run into any issues!

* * *

**You:**

get user widget object has a target and a return value. I cant set an execution pin to it or get the owningactor variable from it.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Ah, I see the issue now! The confusion likely arises from the fact that the **Widget Component** doesn’t directly expose the internal widget in a way you can manipulate it easily through standard node-based actions.

Let’s clarify the steps and use the correct method to access the widget and set the `OwningActor`.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Setting the Owning Actor and Displaying the Widget

### Step 1: Access the Widget Properly

You need to access the internal widget (user widget object) from the **Widget Component** and set the `OwningActor` variable. Here's the correct way to do it:

#### 1.1 Add the Widget Component to Your Target Actor

* You’ve already done this, but just to reiterate:
    1. In your target blueprint (`BP_Target`), add a **Widget Component**.
    2. Set the **Widget Class** in the Details panel to your health bar widget (e.g., `WB_HealthBar_Target`).
    3. Position it above the target’s head.

#### 1.2 Access the User Widget Object and Set `OwningActor`

To properly interact with the widget added as a component, we use the following steps:

1. **Drag the Widget Component into the Graph**:
    
    * In the **Event Graph** of your target blueprint, drag in the **Widget Component** from the Components list (the one you added in Step 1.1).
2. **Get the User Widget Object**:
    
    * From the **Widget Component**, drag off a pin and search for **Get User Widget Object**.
    * This node gives you access to the actual widget (i.e., `WB_HealthBar_Target`), and from here, you can manipulate its properties.
3. **Cast to Your Widget Blueprint**:
    
    * Drag off the **Return Value** of **Get User Widget Object** and search for **Cast To WB_HealthBar_Target** (or whatever your widget is named).
    * This cast allows you to access any exposed variables or functions in the widget blueprint.
4. **Set the `OwningActor` Variable**:
    
    * From the **As WB_HealthBar_Target** output, drag off and search for **Set OwningActor** (the variable you created earlier in the widget).
    * Connect the execution pin of the **Cast to WB_HealthBar_Target** node to this.
    * Set the `OwningActor` to **Self** (drag off from the **Self** node, which refers to the target actor).

### Step 2: Binding the Health Bar

Now, ensure your health bar widget updates the health dynamically based on the `OwningActor`:

#### 2.1 Open the Health Bar Widget

* Open your health bar widget (`WB_HealthBar_Target`).

#### 2.2 Modify the Binding to Get the Health from the Target

1. **Open the Binding Function** for the health bar’s **Percent**.
2. Drag off the `OwningActor` variable, and **Cast to BP_Target** (your target blueprint).
3. After casting, **Get Health** from the target blueprint.
4. Divide the health by the max health (e.g., 100) and return that value to the **Return Node**.

### Step 3: Compile and Test

1. **Compile** and **Save** both your target blueprint and the widget blueprint.
2. **Play** the game. The health bar should now appear above the target’s head and update as it takes damage.

### Final Thoughts

* **Get User Widget Object** is crucial here because the widget component is a wrapper, and the actual widget instance needs to be accessed through it.
* After casting the returned widget object to your specific widget blueprint class (like `WB_HealthBar_Target`), you can then set the `OwningActor` and make it dynamic.

Let me know if you need more clarification on any part!

* * *

**You:**

okay I need the health bar on the targets to always face the player now

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To make the health bar always face the player, you can set the **Widget Component** to use **Screen Space** or update it dynamically to face the player using a Blueprint.

### Method 1: Use Screen Space in Widget Component Settings

This is the easiest method and should work if you want the widget to always face the camera directly (like a 2D UI element).

#### Steps:

1. **Select the Widget Component** in the target blueprint (`BP_Target`).
2. In the **Details** panel, under **User Interface**, find the **Space** setting.
3. Change the **Space** from **World** to **Screen**.

This makes the widget behave like a HUD, and it will always face the camera as a 2D overlay.

### Method 2: Rotate the Widget to Always Face the Player (For 3D Widgets)

If you want the widget to stay in 3D space but always rotate to face the player, you’ll need to add some logic to update the widget’s rotation based on the player’s location.

#### Steps:

1. **Open the Target Blueprint** (`BP_Target`).
2. In the **Event Graph**, find the `Event Tick` node (or create one if it doesn’t exist).
3. **Get a Reference to the Player**:
    * Drag off the `Event Tick` and search for **Get Player Character** or **Get Player Pawn**.
4. **Get the Widget Component**:
    * Drag in your **Widget Component** (the one with the health bar) from the **Components** panel.
5. **Look at Player**:
    * From the **Widget Component**, drag off and search for **Set World Rotation**.
    * For the rotation value, you want the widget to "look at" the player. To do this:
        1. Drag off from the **Player Character** reference and search for **Get Actor Location**.
        2. Drag off from **Self** (or `BP_Target`) and also search for **Get Actor Location**.
        3. From the **Self** location, drag off and search for **Find Look at Rotation**.
            * Input the target location (Player's location) and the start location (Target's location).
        4. Connect the **Find Look at Rotation** output to the **Set World Rotation** node for the Widget Component.

This will make the widget rotate and always face the player in 3D space.

### Method 3: Use "Face Camera" Component

Unreal Engine also has a **Billboard** component for simple 2D sprites or UI elements that always face the camera. While this is more commonly used for sprites, you can explore this if you want a simple, less complex solution for 3D widgets.

Would you like more specific guidance on any of these methods? Let me know what works best for your setup!

**You:**

okay all of that works, but the health bar percentage isn't displaying correctly. Every hit removes 20 from the health and I am printing the health value to the console every time it is hit and is correctly going from 100 to 80 to 60 to 40 to 20 to 0 and disappears, but the healthbar doesn't update properly, it doesn't move for the first hit, then for the second shrinks a hair, then for the third it is halfway, the 4th it doesn't move, then the 5th, it finally dies

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The issue you're describing with the health bar percentage not updating correctly suggests that the calculation for the health bar's **Percent** (the fill value of the progress bar) may not be properly dividing the health by the correct maximum health value or not updating smoothly.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

#### 1. Check the Health Calculation in the Widget

You want the **Percent** value of the health bar to be between `0.0` and `1.0` (representing 0% to 100%). This means you should calculate the percentage as:

```sql
Percent = Current Health / Max Health
```

For example, if your `Current Health` is 80 and the `Max Health` is 100, the **Percent** should be `0.8`.

#### Steps to Double-Check:

1. **Open your `WB_HealthBar_Target` widget.**
    
2. Go to the function that calculates the progress bar’s **Percent** (the function bound to the progress bar).
    
3. **Ensure the Division is Correct**:
    
    * The calculation should divide the **Current Health** by the **Max Health**.
    * For example:
        
        ```sql
        Percent = Current Health / 100.0
        ```
        
    * The max health should be a **float** like `100.0` to avoid integer division (which can cause the value to be incorrectly rounded).
4. **Check the Output of the Percent Calculation**:
    
    * Add a **Print String** node in the widget's percent function after the division.
    * Print the result of the health bar's **Percent** to the console to verify it outputs values between `0.0` and `1.0` after each hit.
    * For example:
        * First hit: `0.8`
        * Second hit: `0.6`
        * Third hit: `0.4`, etc.

#### 2. Check the Progress Bar Update in the Game

The progress bar may not be updating correctly in real-time. Here's how to check that:

1. **Ensure the Widget is Refreshed**:
    * Make sure that the progress bar's **Percent** is re-calculated every time the target's health changes. The widget needs to update each time the health variable is modified.
    * If you're using a binding for the progress bar, this should happen automatically, but it’s good to confirm the health change is being properly communicated to the widget.

#### 3. Additional Debugging

1. **Max Health Should Be Consistent**:
    
    * Ensure that the max health value is consistently set to `100.0` across your logic and not being changed elsewhere in the code. You could store it as a constant or in the target actor to ensure consistency.
2. **Check the Health Decrease Logic**:
    
    * Ensure the health value is decreasing as expected and that no other logic is interfering with the health updates.
    * The health should consistently decrease by 20 each time the target is hit, as you're printing to the console.

### Example Node Setup for the Health Bar Percent Calculation:

* **Health Bar Widget Percent Binding**:
    
    ```sql
    Percent = Current Health / 100.0
    ```
    
    * `Current Health` is the health value from your `BP_Target`.
    * `100.0` is the max health.

### Visual Debugging:

You can also add debug prints directly inside the health bar widget to print out the calculated **Percent** every time it changes:

```plaintext
"Health: " + Current Health + " Percent: " + Percent
```

This should help track where the health bar might be misbehaving.

Would you like me to walk you through any of these steps in more detail? Let me know if any part of the solution still isn’t clear!

* * *

**You:**

the percentage is correct as well from the print statements, but it isn't updating properly visually from the widget and the division is correct as well

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

It sounds like the percentage is calculating correctly but the health bar widget isn't visually updating in sync with the health variable. Since the calculation is correct, the issue might lie in the timing or mechanism of the widget update. Here are a few things you can try to ensure the progress bar updates correctly:

### 1. **Ensure the Widget is Updating Properly**

* If the health percentage is correct but the widget isn’t reflecting the updates visually, you may need to ensure the widget is refreshing when the health changes.

#### Check if the Widget Binding is Firing Correctly:

* If you're using **bindings** in your widget for the progress bar, the widget will check the health value each frame. However, sometimes these bindings don’t refresh as expected.
* To fix this, you can manually force an update when health changes instead of relying purely on bindings.

### 2. **Use "Set Percent" Instead of a Binding** (Manual Update Method)

Instead of relying on automatic bindings, you can manually set the progress bar's value using the **Set Percent** function whenever the health changes. This will ensure the progress bar visually updates as soon as health changes.

#### Steps to Switch to Manual Updating:

1. **Remove the Binding**:
    
    * Open the health bar widget (`WB_HealthBar_Target`).
    * Select the **Progress Bar** and, in the **Details** panel, under **Percent**, click the **Bind** button and choose **Unbind** to remove the binding.
2. **Create a Custom Function to Update the Health Bar**:
    
    * In the widget’s **Graph**, create a new custom event (e.g., `UpdateHealthBar`).
    * In this function, add the following logic:
        1. **Get the Progress Bar** (drag the progress bar into the graph).
        2. **Use Set Percent** on the progress bar.
        3. **Calculate the Percent**:
            * For example, drag from the `OwningActor` (the target) and get the `Health`.
            * Divide the health by the max health (e.g., `Health / 100`).
            * Use the resulting value (between 0 and 1) to set the percent of the progress bar.
3. **Call the Update Function from the Target**:
    
    * In your **BP_Target** blueprint, after reducing health when a projectile hits, call this new `UpdateHealthBar` function.
    * You can do this by first **getting the widget component** attached to the target, using **Get User Widget Object**, and casting it to the correct widget class (`WB_HealthBar_Target`).
    * Then call the `UpdateHealthBar` function to manually update the progress bar.

### Example Flow:

* **BP_Target**: After health is reduced, call `UpdateHealthBar` on the widget component to ensure it refreshes.
* **WB_HealthBar_Target**: The custom function `UpdateHealthBar` calculates the percent and sets it directly on the progress bar.

### 3. **Check the Widget Update Frequency**

* Ensure that **Tick Frequency** for your widget or health bar is correct and not set too low, which could be causing delays between updates.

### 4. **Try Rebinding the Widget** (If Using Bindings)

* Sometimes widget bindings can break after being triggered multiple times. You can **rebind** the health value in the widget when health changes:
    * Unbind the `Percent` and then bind it again in your logic to "force" an update. This approach sometimes resolves issues where bindings fail to refresh consistently.

### Summary:

1. **Manual Update**: Switch from binding to manual update using the `Set Percent` node. Call this update every time health changes in the target.
2. **Ensure Correct Frequency**: Check that the widget is being updated often enough.
3. **Force Refresh**: If using bindings, try rebinding or refreshing the binding after each health change.

**You:**

it has smoething to do with the way the canvas is set up and how it is imported as a widget over the target. changing the canvas shape and stuff changes how the progress bar is displayed

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

It sounds like the problem might be due to the way the widget's **Canvas Panel** is configured, which could affect how the health bar (progress bar) scales and displays over the target. Let’s make sure that the canvas and its components are properly anchored and sized.

### Step-by-Step Fix for Canvas Setup in the Widget

#### 1. Check the **Canvas Panel** and Anchors

The **Canvas Panel** is the root element in your widget, and all other UI elements (like the progress bar) are children of this canvas. If the widget isn't anchored correctly, it might scale improperly, especially when it's attached to a 3D actor.

1. **Open the Widget Blueprint** (`WB_HealthBar_Target`).
    
2. **Check the Anchors**:
    
    * Select the **Progress Bar** in the **Designer** view.
    * In the **Details Panel**, look for the **Anchors** section.
    * Set the anchor to the **center** (or whichever point makes sense for your health bar's design). Anchoring to the center is often a good default to avoid unwanted scaling behavior.
3. **Size the Canvas Properly**:
    
    * Make sure that the **Canvas Panel** itself has a defined size or anchors that work well when the widget is applied over the target.
    * Select the **Canvas Panel** in the hierarchy (it's the root element).
    * Check the **Size** settings. For a health bar, it’s usually good to manually specify a size (e.g., 200x50 or another appropriate size).
4. **Set the Progress Bar Size**:
    
    * Select the **Progress Bar** and check its **Size** in the **Details Panel** under **Slot (Canvas Panel)**.
    * Ensure the progress bar has a fixed size (e.g., 200x20), and make sure it isn't set to "auto-size" unless that is specifically what you want.

#### 2. Disable or Adjust **Size to Content** (if applicable)

Sometimes the **Size to Content** option can affect the display of your UI elements, causing them to resize in unintended ways.

1. **Select the Progress Bar** in the widget.
2. In the **Details** panel, check if the **Size to Content** option is enabled.
    * If enabled, try **disabling** it to manually control the size of the progress bar.
    * If you want the bar to automatically resize, ensure the size scaling is appropriate for its parent (canvas or other elements).

#### 3. Check **Scaling Settings** on the Widget Component in `BP_Target`

Once you've fixed the canvas and progress bar setup, make sure the widget component (attached to the target actor) doesn’t have any unexpected scaling.

1. **Go to the Target Blueprint** (`BP_Target`).
2. Select the **Widget Component**.
3. In the **Details** panel, look for **Draw Size** and **Draw Scale** settings.
    * Ensure the **Draw Size** is appropriately sized for how you want the health bar to appear.
    * Adjust the **Draw Scale** to `1.0` if it's too small or large, as this could be affecting how the progress bar is being displayed.

#### 4. Test the Canvas and Progress Bar

After making these adjustments:

1. **Compile and Save** the changes in both the widget and the target blueprint.
2. **Test** the game again to see if the health bar’s visual issues are resolved.

### Additional Tips:

* **Uniform Scaling**: Make sure there’s no non-uniform scaling being applied to the widget component in `BP_Target`. Uneven scaling can distort how the progress bar is displayed.
* **Fit to Size**: If your health bar should resize based on the canvas or target’s health, verify that you’re using the correct settings for either manual sizing or automatic scaling.

**You:**

Okay I have my level that has targets to kill and player health that when drops to 0 restarts the level. However, when the player finishes the level, a screen pops up that allows you to restart or quit. I would like to instead, without showing the screen, automatically load a new level. currently the screen logic showing up is determined by my target bp checking that the targets destroyed = total targets. if so, it runs "checkGoal" which is in my first person character blueprint. check goal again checks if total targets is the amount that have been destroyed and if so calls on "endGame". endgame pauses the game and displays a widget to have the user select if they want to quit or restart. do I just need to change the end game logic to instead load a new level instead of pausing and displaying a widget?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you're right! You can modify the **`endGame`** logic to automatically load the new level instead of pausing the game and showing a widget. Here's how you can change the logic:

### Step-by-Step: Modify the End Game Logic to Load a New Level

#### 1. Modify the `endGame` Function

1. **Open the First Person Character Blueprint** where the **`endGame`** function is located.
    
2. **Find the `endGame` Function**:
    
    * Locate the function or event you currently use to pause the game and display the widget.
    * Instead of pausing the game and displaying the widget, you’ll trigger a level change.

#### 2. Add the Logic to Load the Next Level

1. **Remove or Comment Out** the nodes related to **Pausing the Game** and **Displaying the Widget** (so you can keep them for future reference, in case you want to reuse them).
    
2. **Add the `Open Level` Node**:
    
    * From the **Execution Pin** of the logic that previously paused the game, drag out and search for **Open Level**.
    * This node allows you to load a new level.
3. **Specify the Level Name**:
    
    * In the **Open Level** node, enter the name of the level you want to load next (e.g., `"Level_2"`). Make sure the name matches exactly with the level name in your project.
4. **Compile and Save**:
    
    * After you add this, **Compile** and **Save** the blueprint.

#### 3. Test the Logic

1. **Play the Game** and kill all the targets.
2. Once the condition for the targets being destroyed is met, the game should automatically load the new level without showing the screen for quitting or restarting.

### Example Blueprint Flow:

In your **`endGame`** function:

* After checking that all targets are destroyed, instead of pausing the game and showing the widget, call **`Open Level`** and load the new level.

### Additional Tips:

* If you plan to have multiple levels with different names, you can pass the next level’s name dynamically.
* Ensure the level you are loading is listed in the **Project Settings** under **Maps & Modes** > **Game Default Map** or **Editor Default Map** to avoid any issues with loading levels.

How can I duplicate the current level I have open as a new level with a different name?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Duplicating your current level and saving it with a different name is simple in Unreal Engine. Here's how you can do it:

### Step-by-Step: Duplicating the Current Level

#### 1. Open the Level You Want to Duplicate

* Ensure the level you want to duplicate is open in the **Level Editor**.

#### 2. Save the Current Level As a New Level

1. **Go to the File Menu**:
    
    * In the top-left corner of the Unreal Editor, click on **File**.
2. **Select "Save Current As"**:
    
    * In the dropdown, select **Save Current As**.
3. **Choose a New Name for the Duplicated Level**:
    
    * A file dialog will appear, allowing you to specify a new name for the duplicated level.
    * Choose a name for the new level (e.g., `Level_2`) and select where you want to save it in your project’s folder structure (it will usually default to the "Maps" folder).
4. **Click "Save"**:
    
    * This will create an exact copy of the currently open level and save it as a new level with the name you specified.

#### 3. Verify the New Level

1. **Open the New Level**:
    
    * After saving, go to the **Content Browser** and navigate to where you saved the new level.
    * Double-click on the new level to open it and verify that everything is duplicated as expected.
2. **Edit the New Level**:
    
    * You can now make changes specific to the new level, such as modifying the layout, adding new assets, or changing objectives.

### That's it!

Now, you have a duplicated level with a different name that you can edit independently of the original. Let me know if you run into any issues or need further clarification!

### Step-by-Step: Set the New Player Blueprint in the Second Level

#### 1. Create the New Character Blueprint (if not already done)

If you haven't done this yet, follow these steps:

1. **Duplicate the Original Character Blueprint**:
    
    * Go to the **Content Browser** and find your original `BP_First_Person_Character`.
    * Right-click on it and select **Duplicate**.
    * Give it a new name (e.g., `BP_First_Person_Character_Level2`).
2. **Customize the New Character Blueprint**:
    
    * Open your new character blueprint and make the necessary changes specific to the second level (e.g., new abilities, different stats, etc.).

#### 2. Create or Edit the Game Mode for the Second Level

You’ll need to specify which character blueprint to use in your game mode.

1. **Create a Custom Game Mode** (if not already created):
    * In the **Content Browser**, right-click and go to **Blueprint Class** > **Game Mode Base**.
    * Name it something like `GM_Level2`.
2. **Set the Default Pawn Class**:
    * Open the newly created game mode (`GM_Level2`).
    * In the **Details Panel**, find **Default Pawn Class**.
    * Click the drop-down and select your new player character blueprint (`BP_First_Person_Character_Level2`).

#### 3. Assign the Game Mode to the Second Level

Now that you’ve created or edited the game mode, you need to assign it to your second level.

1. **Open Your Second Level**:
    
    * Open the second level in the **Level Editor**.
2. **Open World Settings**:
    
    * If the **World Settings** tab isn’t visible, go to the top of the screen and click **Window** > **World Settings** to open it.
3. **Set the Game Mode Override**:
    
    * In the **World Settings** panel, find the **Game Mode Override** option.
    * From the drop-down, select your custom game mode (`GM_Level2`).
4. **Save the Level**.
    

### Step 4: Test the New Character

* **Play the Level** and ensure that your new player blueprint (`BP_First_Person_Character_Level2`) is being used when you start the second level.

### Notes:

* The **Game Mode** dictates which character blueprint is used, so assigning a different game mode per level allows you to have unique characters for each level.
* You can also set different HUDs, controllers, or other elements in the game mode to suit the new level.

**You:**

So i cant select my new player controller in the game mode details window, it is not one of the options

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If you're not able to select your new player character in the **Default Pawn Class** section of the game mode, it could be because of one of the following reasons:

1. The new player character blueprint might not be compiled correctly.
2. It might not inherit from the correct base class that Unreal expects for a pawn.

Let’s troubleshoot and resolve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Check the Inheritance of Your New Player Character Blueprint

Make sure your new `BP_First_Person_Character_Level2` is inheriting from the correct base class.

1. **Open Your New Character Blueprint**:
    
    * Go to the **Content Browser** and find `BP_First_Person_Character_Level2`.
    * Open it in the Blueprint Editor.
2. **Check the Parent Class**:
    
    * In the top-right corner of the Blueprint Editor, check the **Parent Class** of your character.
    * It should inherit from **Character** (or **Pawn**, depending on your setup). If it doesn't, this could be the issue.
    
    Example:
    
    * Parent Class: **Character** (or **FirstPersonCharacter**).

### Step 2: Ensure the Blueprint is Properly Compiled and Saved

1. In the **Blueprint Editor**, click **Compile** at the top-left.
2. After compiling, click **Save**.
3. Close the Blueprint Editor.

### Step 3: Recheck the Game Mode

1. **Go Back to the Game Mode Blueprint** (`GM_Level2` or your custom game mode).
2. **Open the Game Mode Blueprint**.
3. In the **Details Panel**, under **Default Pawn Class**, try selecting `BP_First_Person_Character_Level2`.

### Step 4: Try Reassigning the Game Mode

1. **Open Your Second Level**.
2. Go to the **World Settings** and make sure the **Game Mode Override** is still set to your custom game mode (`GM_Level2`).
3. Check again to see if your new player character shows up in the **Default Pawn Class** drop-down.

### Alternative: Manually Assigning the Pawn in World Settings

If the new character still doesn't show up in the drop-down, you can manually assign the new pawn in **World Settings** as an alternative:

1. **Open the Second Level**.
2. In **World Settings**, scroll to **Override Pawn Class**.
3. You can manually assign your new player character there to override the default pawn from the game mode.

### Bonus Step: Restart the Editor (if Necessary)

If all else fails, sometimes Unreal Engine may need a restart to refresh newly created assets.

1. **Restart Unreal Engine** and reopen your project.
2. Retry the steps above.

### If the Issue Persists

* Double-check the name of the blueprint and ensure no typos in the naming convention.
* If the new player blueprint is still missing from the list, there may be an issue with how it was created, and duplicating it again could resolve this.

**You:**

well the game mode is pickupscore game mode and the players base class is character just like the first levels player, but it is not an option

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

It seems like there may be some confusion or issue with how the **Game Mode** or **Blueprints** are interacting. Let's walk through potential fixes:

### Step-by-Step: Troubleshooting Why Your Player Blueprint is Not Showing in the Game Mode

#### 1. Ensure the Game Mode is Correctly Set

The **PickupScoreGameMode** should allow you to specify a **Default Pawn Class**. Ensure that you are working with the correct game mode for your second level.

1. **Open Your `PickupScoreGameMode` Blueprint** (if it's a custom GameMode).
    
    * If this is a custom game mode (or a default one), open it and make sure it's not locked to a specific pawn class.
    * You should still be able to specify the default pawn class.
2. **Check if the Default Pawn Class is Set Elsewhere**:
    
    * The default pawn class could be hardcoded or set via another method in the game mode.
    * Open the game mode and see if there are any scripts or logic overriding the pawn class.

#### 2. Double-Check Player Blueprint Compatibility

Make sure your new player blueprint is correctly set up.

1. **Open your new player blueprint** (`BP_First_Person_Character_Level2`).
2. **Compile and Save** the blueprint to ensure there are no compile errors.
3. Verify that the **Parent Class** of the blueprint is **Character** (this is critical for it to be used as a pawn).

#### 3. Manually Set the Default Pawn Class via the Game Mode

If the player blueprint still doesn’t appear in the dropdown:

1. **Manually Assign the Default Pawn Class**:
    
    * Open the **`PickupScoreGameMode`** in the blueprint editor.
    * Go to the **Default Pawn Class** and click the drop-down arrow.
    * If your new player blueprint is still not appearing, try **manually typing the full name** of the new player blueprint (e.g., `BP_First_Person_Character_Level2`).
    * Unreal Engine should auto-complete the name once you start typing.
2. **Override in World Settings**:
    
    * Open **World Settings** in your second level.
    * Scroll to the **Override Pawn Class** setting in **World Settings**.
    * Manually type or select your new player character blueprint here.

#### 4. Restart Unreal Engine

Sometimes Unreal Engine may not immediately register new blueprints, especially in cases where the default assets like characters and game modes are involved. Restart the editor:

1. **Restart Unreal Engine** and re-open your project.
2. Revisit the **Game Mode** or **World Settings** and try to assign the new character.

#### 5. Ensure the Blueprint Isn't Restricted

Check if there are any restrictions in your game mode or the project settings that may prevent the new character from being selectable.

* Open **Project Settings** > **Maps & Modes**.
* Ensure that the **Default Game Mode** and the **Override Game Mode** for each level are set properly.

### Alternative: Duplicate the Game Mode (if Necessary)

If the game mode itself is causing the issue and you're not able to set the correct pawn class, you can duplicate the `PickupScoreGameMode` and set it up for your second level:

1. **Right-click** on `PickupScoreGameMode` and **Duplicate** it.
2. Rename the new game mode (e.g., `GM_Level2`).
3. Open it and set the **Default Pawn Class** to your new player blueprint.
4. Assign this new game mode to your second level in **World Settings**.

**You:**

oh wait. there seems to be 2 blueprints. One is a first person controller, one is a first person character. the gamemode wants the controller, so I made a copy of the first one. How do I tie my new character to this new controller then?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To tie your new **First Person Character** to the new **First Person Controller**, you need to ensure that your controller is properly set to possess and control the character when the game starts.

Here’s how to tie the new character to the new controller:

### Step-by-Step: Tie the New Character to the New Controller

#### 1. Set Up the Game Mode

1. **Open the New Game Mode** (`PickupScoreGameMode` or whatever custom game mode you are using).
2. In the **Details Panel** of the game mode:
    * **Default Pawn Class**: Set this to your new **First Person Character** (`BP_First_Person_Character_Level2`).
    * **Player Controller Class**: Set this to your new **First Person Controller** (`BP_First_Person_Controller_Level2`).

#### 2. Set the Character to Be Possessed by the Controller

1. **Open the Blueprint for the New First Person Character** (`BP_First_Person_Character_Level2`).
    
2. In the **Event Graph**, ensure there is a node that allows the controller to possess this character:
    
    * On **Begin Play**, you should have a node called **Possessed** or **Auto Possess Player**.
3. **Check Auto Possess Settings**:
    
    * Select your character in the **Components** panel.
    * In the **Details** panel, under **Pawn**:
        * Set **Auto Possess Player** to **Player 0** (this means the character will automatically be possessed by the first player when the game starts).

#### 3. Ensure the New Controller is Possessing the New Character

1. **Open the New First Person Controller** (`BP_First_Person_Controller_Level2`).
2. In the **Event Graph**, check if it has logic to control and possess the character.
    * By default, the controller automatically possesses the pawn set by the game mode.

If you want to manually possess the character:

1. On **Begin Play** in the controller blueprint, add the following:
    
    * **Get Player Character**: This node gets the character you want to possess.
    * **Possess**: Drag off from the output of **Get Player Character** and select **Possess** to tell the controller to possess the character.
    
    This ensures that the new controller is linked to your new character.
    

#### 4. Set the New Game Mode in World Settings (for the Level)

1. **Open Your Second Level**.
2. Go to **World Settings** (from the **Window** menu if it’s not already open).
3. In the **Game Mode Override** section, set the following:
    * **Game Mode**: Set to `PickupScoreGameMode` (or your custom game mode).
    * **Default Pawn Class**: Ensure it’s set to the new **First Person Character**.
    * **Player Controller Class**: Ensure it’s set to the new **First Person Controller**.

#### 5. Test the Setup

1. **Compile** and **Save** all blueprints.
2. Play the game to make sure your new controller and character are correctly linked.

### Summary:

* **Game Mode** should link the new character to the new controller.
* Ensure the **Auto Possess Player** option is set to **Player 0** in the character.
* If needed, manually possess the character from the controller using the **Possess** node.

**You:**

this is complicated. the only difference is that I need to load in the bp first person character blueprint level 2 if I am currently on level 1, if I am on level 2, I need to load the "menuLevel". So how can I just change the original bp logic to do this in the endgame function

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Got it! If the only difference between the two levels is that you need to load a different character on Level 2, and then load the menu level afterward, you can simplify this by modifying the **`endGame`** function to check which level you are on, and load the appropriate character or menu level based on that.

Here’s how you can approach it without changing the entire game mode or controller setup:

### Step-by-Step: Modify the `endGame` Function to Load Different Levels

#### 1. Modify the `endGame` Logic to Check the Current Level

1. **Open the Blueprint** where your **`endGame`** function is located (this is in your **First Person Character** blueprint, as mentioned earlier).
    
2. **Check the Current Level**:
    
    * In the **Event Graph**, inside the **`endGame`** function, you need to add logic to check which level the player is currently on.
    * Right-click and search for **Get Current Level Name**. This node returns the name of the level currently being played.
3. **Add a Branch** to Check the Level:
    
    * Drag off from **Get Current Level Name** and compare the level name using an **Equal (String)** node.
    * Set the comparison string to the name of **Level 1** (the first level in your game).
4. **Branch Logic**:
    
    * If the current level is **Level 1**, call the **Open Level** node and set the level to **Level 2**.
    * If the current level is **Level 2**, call **Open Level** and set the level to **menuLevel**.

Here’s the flow:

* **Get Current Level Name** → **Equal (String)** (compare to "Level 1") → **Branch**:
    * If **True**: **Open Level** to "Level 2".
    * If **False**: **Open Level** to "menuLevel".

#### 2. Implement the Logic for Level Loading

1. **True Branch** (If on **Level 1**):
    
    * Call the **Open Level** node and specify `"Level_2"` (or whatever your second level is named).
2. **False Branch** (If on **Level 2**):
    
    * Call **Open Level** and specify `"menuLevel"` (or whatever your menu level is called).

#### 3. Update the `endGame` Function

1. Once you have added the logic to check the level and load the appropriate next level, make sure it’s tied into your existing **`endGame`** function.
    
2. **Remove** or **Disable** the current logic that pauses the game and shows the widget, and replace it with this new level-checking logic.
    

#### Example Blueprint Flow:

* **Get Current Level Name**
* **Equal (String)** (check if it's "Level 1")
* **Branch**:
    * If **True**: **Open Level** "Level 2".
    * If **False**: **Open Level** "menuLevel".

### Step 4: Test the Logic

1. **Compile** and **Save** the blueprint.
2. Test the game:
    * When all targets are destroyed on **Level 1**, it should automatically load **Level 2**.
    * When all targets are destroyed on **Level 2**, it should load the **menuLevel**.

### Summary:

* Use **Get Current Level Name** to check the level.
* Based on the current level, load either **Level 2** or the **menuLevel** using **Open Level**.
* This logic is placed in your existing **`endGame`** function, replacing the widget and pause screen.

Would you like any additional help implementing this, or further details on any step?

* * *

**You:**

okay everything seems to be working. Now before I design this 2nd level, I need 1 more level to work with all of this. I need a menu screen that I named MenuLevel as a new level. I need 2 buttons on this level on the screen: 1 loads the 1st level, the other quits the game

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To create a **MenuLevel** with two buttons—one to load the first level and the other to quit the game—follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create the `MenuLevel`

1. **Create a New Level**:
    * In the **Content Browser**, right-click and go to **Level**.
    * Name it **MenuLevel**.
2. **Open `MenuLevel`**:
    * Double-click to open the new **MenuLevel** in the **Level Editor**.

### Step 2: Create a New Widget for the Menu

1. **Create the Widget Blueprint**:
    
    * In the **Content Browser**, right-click and choose **User Interface > Widget Blueprint**.
    * Name it `MainMenuWidget`.
2. **Design the Widget**:
    
    * Open the `MainMenuWidget`.
    * In the **Designer View**, add two buttons and text:
        1. **Button 1**: This will load **Level 1**.
        2. **Button 2**: This will quit the game.

#### 2.1 Add Buttons and Text:

1. Drag a **Button** widget from the **Palette** to the canvas.
2. Inside each button, drag a **Text** widget and set it as follows:
    * **Button 1**: Add text like "Start Game" (for Level 1).
    * **Button 2**: Add text like "Quit Game".
3. Arrange the buttons and text however you like.

### Step 3: Set Up the Button Logic

#### 3.1 Set Up the Button to Load Level 1

1. **Select the Start Game Button**.
2. In the **Details Panel**, scroll down to the **Events** section.
3. Click the **+** next to **OnClicked** to create a new event for this button.

In the graph:

1. **Add an `Open Level` node**.
2. Connect the event to the **Open Level** node.
3. Set the level name to `"Level_1"` (or whatever your first level is named).

#### 3.2 Set Up the Button to Quit the Game

1. **Select the Quit Game Button**.
2. In the **Details Panel**, scroll down to the **Events** section.
3. Click the **+** next to **OnClicked** to create a new event for the quit button.

In the graph:

1. **Add a `Quit Game` node**.
    * This will close the game entirely when clicked.

### Step 4: Add the Widget to the Level

1. **Open the MenuLevel Blueprint**:
    * Go to **World Settings** and ensure that **Game Mode Override** is set to the proper game mode (you can create a basic game mode if needed).
2. **Add the Widget to the Viewport**:
    * In the **Level Blueprint** for **MenuLevel**, go to the **Event Graph**.
    * On **Begin Play**, create the widget and add it to the viewport:
        1. Right-click and add an **Event Begin Play** node.
        2. Drag off from the node and search for **Create Widget**.
        3. Set the **Class** to `MainMenuWidget`.
        4. Drag off the return value and add an **Add to Viewport** node.

### Step 5: Test the Menu

1. **Compile and Save** the widget and level blueprints.
2. Play the **MenuLevel**.
    * The buttons should appear on the screen.
    * Clicking **Start Game** should load **Level 1**, and clicking **Quit Game** should close the game.

### Summary:

* **Button 1**: Loads **Level 1** using `Open Level`.
* **Button 2**: Quits the game using `Quit Game`.
* The widget is created and added to the viewport when the **MenuLevel** begins.

**You:**

okay when I load the main menu level from the level 2, the cursor is gone from my screen and I cant click any buttons

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The issue with the cursor not appearing on the **MenuLevel** is likely because Unreal Engine doesn't automatically show the mouse cursor when switching from a gameplay level to a menu level.

You’ll need to manually show the mouse cursor when the **MenuLevel** loads, and ensure the input mode is set to UI so that the buttons can be clicked.

### Steps to Show the Cursor and Set Input Mode for the Menu

#### 1. Enable the Mouse Cursor in the Menu Level

You need to enable the mouse cursor when the **MenuLevel** is loaded.

1. **Open the `MenuLevel` Blueprint**:
    
    * Open the **Level Blueprint** for the **MenuLevel**.
2. **Add the Logic to Show the Cursor**:
    
    * In the **Event Graph**, find the **Event Begin Play** node (or add one if it’s not already there).
3. **Add the Logic to Show the Mouse Cursor**:
    
    * Drag off from **Event Begin Play** and add a **Get Player Controller** node.
    * From the **Get Player Controller** node, drag off and add a **Set Show Mouse Cursor** node.
    * Check the box for **Show Mouse Cursor**.
4. **Set Input Mode for UI Only**:
    
    * After the **Set Show Mouse Cursor** node, drag off and add a **Set Input Mode UI Only** node.
    * In the **Widget to Focus** pin of **Set Input Mode UI Only**, connect the widget you created (the `MainMenuWidget`).
    * You can connect the player controller reference from the **Get Player Controller** node into the target input of the **Set Input Mode UI Only**.

#### Example Flow:

* **Event Begin Play** → **Get Player Controller** → **Set Show Mouse Cursor (Checked)** → **Set Input Mode UI Only** (with the menu widget focused).

#### 2. Compile and Save

* **Compile** and **Save** the **Level Blueprint**.

#### 3. Test the Menu

1. **Play** the game.
    * When the **MenuLevel** is loaded, the mouse cursor should now appear.
    * You should be able to click on the buttons to start the game or quit.

### Summary of Fix:

* Show the mouse cursor when loading the **MenuLevel** by using **Set Show Mouse Cursor** in the **Level Blueprint**.
* Set the input mode to **UI Only** so that the mouse input is focused on the menu buttons.

Let me know if this works or if you'd like further help!

**You:**

Everything works, but I get the error when I close the game that get player controller expects a valid player when in the menu level, there is no player

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The error you're seeing occurs because in the **MenuLevel**, there’s no actual player controller spawned (since the game is just showing a menu). However, you can still access a valid player controller in Unreal’s system even in a UI-only level.

To resolve this, we’ll ensure that the call to **Get Player Controller** works without issues by making a small change to the logic:

### Solution: Check if a Valid Player Controller Exists Before Setting Input Mode

You can avoid the error by checking if the player controller is valid before attempting to use it.

### Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Open the Level Blueprint for MenuLevel**.
    
2. **Modify the Existing Logic**:
    
    * After **Event Begin Play**, right before you call **Get Player Controller**, you’ll add a check to make sure it’s valid.

#### 2.1 Add a Valid Check

1. Drag off from **Get Player Controller** and add an **IsValid** node.
    
    * This will check if a valid player controller exists before proceeding.
2. **Branch Node**:
    
    * Connect the output of **IsValid** to a **Branch** node.
    * If the **IsValid** check is **True**, proceed with your existing logic (show mouse cursor, set input mode UI only).
    * If **False**, do nothing, which avoids errors.

#### Example Flow:

* **Event Begin Play** → **Get Player Controller** → **IsValid** → **Branch**:
    * **True**: Proceed to **Set Show Mouse Cursor** and **Set Input Mode UI Only**.
    * **False**: Do nothing (this avoids the error if there is no valid controller).

### Step 3: Test the Game

1. **Compile** and **Save** your blueprint.
2. Run the game and check if the error is resolved when closing the game from the **MenuLevel**.

### Summary:

* The **IsValid** check ensures that the **Get Player Controller** node only executes when a valid controller exists.
* This avoids the error when no player controller is present (e.g., in the menu level).

Let me know if you need any further clarification or help!

* * *

**You:**

will this still allow the UI of main menu to work??

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, the **IsValid** check will still allow the UI of the main menu to work as expected. The check only ensures that you don't try to access an invalid player controller, which prevents the error when there is no active player controller in the level. However, the **Get Player Controller** should still return a valid controller for UI purposes even in a menu level (since Unreal Engine provides a default player controller for handling UI input).

Here’s how it works:

* **IsValid** simply checks if the player controller exists before trying to use it.
* If **IsValid** is true, the menu UI logic (like showing the cursor and setting input mode to UI) will still execute, ensuring that you can interact with the buttons.
* The only time the **IsValid** check would return **False** is if there’s absolutely no valid player controller at all, which shouldn’t happen unless there’s a problem outside of standard gameplay/UI behavior.

### Recap:

* **IsValid** ensures that if there’s no player controller (unlikely in a menu level), it won’t trigger an error.
* The UI should still work fine because Unreal Engine provides a player controller for interacting with the menu (for mouse input and button clicks).

**You:**

okay I fixed it. However, I need when level 1 or level 2 loads to remove the cursor and make moving the mouse control the look direction of the player. Currently, when the new level loads, I need to click on the screen to have the cursor disappear and gain control over the player again

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To make sure the cursor is hidden and the mouse controls the player’s look direction immediately when **Level 1** or **Level 2** loads, you need to automatically set the input mode and hide the cursor in your player blueprint or in the level's blueprint. Here's how you can do that:

### Step-by-Step: Remove Cursor and Enable Mouse Control

#### 1. Set the Input Mode and Hide the Cursor on Level Load

You need to ensure that when **Level 1** or **Level 2** loads, the input is immediately set to **Game Only**, which allows the mouse to control the player's view.

#### Method 1: Modify the Player Blueprint (Recommended)

1. **Open the `BP_First_Person_Character` Blueprint** (for each level if they are different).
    
2. **Event Begin Play**:
    
    * In the **Event Graph**, locate or add the **Event Begin Play** node.
3. **Get Player Controller**:
    
    * From **Event Begin Play**, add a **Get Player Controller** node.
4. **Set Input Mode Game Only**:
    
    * Drag off from the **Get Player Controller** node and add a **Set Input Mode Game Only** node.
    * This will ensure that mouse input is captured and controls the player’s look direction.
5. **Hide Mouse Cursor**:
    
    * After **Set Input Mode Game Only**, drag off from **Get Player Controller** and add a **Set Show Mouse Cursor** node.
    * Make sure the **Show Mouse Cursor** checkbox is **unchecked** to hide the cursor.

#### Example Flow:

* **Event Begin Play** → **Get Player Controller** → **Set Input Mode Game Only** → **Set Show Mouse Cursor (Unchecked)**.

#### Method 2: Add the Logic in the Level Blueprint (Alternative)

If you prefer to handle this on a per-level basis rather than inside the player blueprint:

1. **Open the Level Blueprint** for **Level 1** or **Level 2**.
    
2. **Event Begin Play**:
    
    * In the **Event Graph**, add an **Event Begin Play** node.
3. **Get Player Controller**:
    
    * Drag off from **Event Begin Play** and add a **Get Player Controller** node.
4. **Set Input Mode Game Only**:
    
    * From the **Get Player Controller** node, add a **Set Input Mode Game Only** node.
5. **Hide Mouse Cursor**:
    
    * After **Set Input Mode Game Only**, add a **Set Show Mouse Cursor** node and make sure **Show Mouse Cursor** is **unchecked**.

#### 2. Compile and Save

1. **Compile and Save** the blueprint (either player or level).
2. **Test the Game** by loading **Level 1** or **Level 2**.

The player should now automatically control the camera with the mouse, and the cursor should be hidden without the need to click on the screen.

### Summary:

* **Set Input Mode Game Only** ensures mouse input controls the player.
* **Set Show Mouse Cursor** hides the cursor when the level starts.
* This logic can be added either in the **Player Blueprint** or **Level Blueprint** depending on your preference.

To make sure your **Main Menu Widget** canvas and its children (buttons, text, etc.) scale automatically with the window size, you can use a **Scale Box** and ensure proper anchoring of your UI elements.

### Step-by-Step: Scale the Main Menu UI to Window Size

#### 1. Wrap the Canvas in a **Scale Box**

1. **Open the `MainMenuWidget`**:
    
    * In the **Content Browser**, open the widget blueprint for the main menu (`MainMenuWidget`).
2. **Wrap the Canvas Panel in a Scale Box**:
    
    * In the **Hierarchy** panel on the left, right-click your root **Canvas Panel**.
    * Select **Wrap With... > Scale Box**.
    * This will make the entire widget content (buttons, text, etc.) scale properly to fit the screen size.

#### 2. Set the **Scale Box** to Scale the Content

1. Select the **Scale Box** you just added.
2. In the **Details** panel on the right:
    * Under **Stretch**, set it to **Scale to Fit** or **Scale to Fill** based on your design preference:
        * **Scale to Fit**: Maintains the aspect ratio of the content while scaling.
        * **Scale to Fill**: Scales the content to fill the available space, possibly stretching the elements.

#### 3. Anchor UI Elements to the Center (or Desired Position)

1. **Select Each Button and Text Element**:
    
    * In the **Designer** view, click on each button or text widget inside your canvas.
2. **Set Anchors**:
    
    * In the **Details** panel, under the **Slot (Canvas Panel)** section, set the **Anchors** to **Center** or another suitable option depending on your design.
    * Anchoring helps keep the UI elements in their relative positions as the window scales.

#### 4. Set Size and Position to Auto-Adjust

1. For each UI element (button, text, etc.), ensure the **Size** and **Position** are not hard-coded.
2. Set **Size to Content** if you want the element to automatically size itself based on its content (for text or buttons).
3. Use percentage-based sizing if you prefer to control the scale more precisely.

### Step 5: Test the Scaling

1. **Compile and Save** the widget.
2. **Play** the game and resize the window to see how the UI scales.

### Summary:

* Wrap the **Canvas Panel** in a **Scale Box** to ensure the UI scales with the window size.
* Adjust the **Anchors** of buttons and text to the center or desired positions.
* Use **Size to Content** and percentage-based sizing for better control over element size.

This setup will make sure the main menu scales dynamically to fit any screen resolution or window size. Let me know if you need more help!

**You:**

So i need to upload my UE5 project to github for grading, however, my project is 19GB and github and git LFS wont allow that... what do I do?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

When working with large Unreal Engine projects, especially ones that exceed GitHub's size limits, you’ll need to trim down the project size before uploading it. You can reduce the size of your project by excluding unnecessary files and focusing only on the essential ones for grading.

### Steps to Upload a Large Unreal Engine Project to GitHub:

#### 1. **Exclude Intermediate, Build, and Derived Data Cache Folders**

The majority of the size in Unreal Engine projects comes from generated and temporary files. You can safely exclude these from your repository.

Here are the folders you can exclude:

* **Binaries/**: Contains compiled binaries. These can be recompiled by anyone using your project.
* **Build/**: Contains platform-specific build files.
* **DerivedDataCache/**: This folder contains cached assets that are generated locally.
* **Intermediate/**: Contains temporary files generated by Unreal during compilation.
* **Saved/**: Contains autosaves, log files, and backup data.
* **.vs/**: Visual Studio project files (if you use Visual Studio).

#### 2. **Create a `.gitignore` File**

You need to create a `.gitignore` file to tell Git which files and folders to ignore when committing.

1. In the root of your Unreal project, create a new file called `.gitignore`.
    
2. Add the following lines to the `.gitignore` file:
    
    ```plaintext
    # Unreal Engine Exclusions
    Binaries/
    DerivedDataCache/
    Intermediate/
    Saved/
    .vs/
    Build/
    
    # Ignore Visual Studio temporary files, build results, and
    *.VC.db
    *.VC.opendb
    *.sln
    *.exe
    *.pdb
    *.user
    *.log
    *.obj
    *.pch
    ```
    

This will significantly reduce the size of your project before uploading it.

#### 3. **Zip Large Assets and Use Git LFS (If Necessary)**

If there are still large assets that must be submitted (like textures, meshes, etc.), and GitHub's file size or Git LFS limits are being exceeded, you can compress or selectively include them:

1. **Compress Large Assets**:
    
    * Large assets (like textures, sounds, etc.) can be compressed into `.zip` files.
    * Upload these `.zip` files to your repository, and add instructions for decompressing them before use.
2. **Use Git LFS for Large Files**:
    
    * Git LFS (Large File Storage) supports files up to 2GB per file. You can use this for large binary assets that cannot be excluded.
    * Follow [Git LFS documentation](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to install and use it correctly.

#### 4. **Test Your Stripped Project**

Before uploading to GitHub, test the project by:

1. Deleting the excluded folders on a local copy of your project.
2. Open the project in Unreal to ensure it regenerates the necessary files and runs correctly.
    * This verifies that your project works fine without the excluded folders.

#### 5. **Push the Project to GitHub**

1. After reducing the size by excluding unnecessary folders, **commit and push** the project to your GitHub repository.

#### 6. **Share Additional Large Files Separately (if Needed)**

If after trimming down the project size you're still above GitHub's limit, consider hosting large assets on a separate cloud service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) and include links in a README file.

### Summary:

* Exclude unnecessary files using a `.gitignore` (Binaries, Intermediate, Saved, etc.).
* Use Git LFS for large assets.
* Zip large files if necessary and include instructions.
* Test the project without the excluded files to ensure it works.
* Upload the optimized project to GitHub.

**You:**

i already have a gitignore setup and it is still huge. how do I find only the assets that I use in my project from asset packs that I downloaded?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To reduce the size of your Unreal Engine project by keeping only the assets that are actually used in the project (from downloaded asset packs or otherwise), you can use Unreal Engine’s **Migrate** tool, which allows you to migrate only the essential assets to a new project. This ensures that only the assets directly referenced in your levels are included.

### Steps to Find and Keep Only the Used Assets in Unreal Engine:

#### 1. **Create a New Project to Migrate Your Assets**

1. **Create a New Empty Project**:
    * In Unreal Engine, create a new blank project (choose the same template, like first-person shooter or whatever suits your project).
    * This new project will be where we "migrate" only the used assets.

#### 2. **Migrate Assets from Your Original Project to the New Project**

1. **Open Your Original Project**:
    
    * Open the project that contains all the downloaded asset packs.
2. **Go to Your Levels Folder**:
    
    * In the **Content Browser**, locate the levels that contain the assets you are using.
    * Right-click on the **Level** file (e.g., `Level1.umap`) and choose **Asset Actions** > **Migrate**.
3. **Migrate Assets**:
    
    * Unreal will automatically gather all the assets used in that level, including meshes, textures, materials, and sounds, even if they are part of large asset packs.
    * A window will pop up, showing you all the assets being migrated. Review them, and click **OK**.
    * **Select the new project’s Content folder** as the destination for the migration.

This will copy only the assets actually referenced in your project, excluding unused content from the asset packs.

#### 3. **Test the New Project**

1. **Open the New Project**:
    * Open the new project where you migrated the assets.
    * Verify that everything works correctly and all the necessary assets are in place.

#### 4. **Delete Unnecessary Content in the New Project**

1. After migrating the used assets to the new project, open the **Content Browser** and check if there are any additional files or folders you don’t need.
2. **Right-click** on any unused folders or files and select **Delete**.

#### 5. **Upload the Slimmed-Down Project to GitHub**

Once you have verified that your new project contains only the assets used in your levels:

1. **Set up the Git repository** for the new project.
2. **Commit** and **push** it to GitHub.

### Alternative: Using the **Reference Viewer**

If you prefer not to migrate, you can manually check which assets are being used in your project:

1. **Right-click on a Level or Asset in the Content Browser**.
2. Select **Reference Viewer**.
3. This will show you all the assets that are directly or indirectly referenced by that level or asset. You can use this tool to track which assets are being used and delete the ones that aren’t.

### Summary:

* **Migrate** the used assets from your original project to a new, empty project.
* This ensures only assets referenced in your levels are included.
* Test the new project and then upload it to GitHub.

Let me know if you'd like more help or if you'd like to explore another approach!

**You:**

the reference viewer solution seems more reasonable. How can I reliably delete everything except my used assets

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The **Reference Viewer** is a powerful tool that helps identify which assets are being used in your Unreal Engine project. By using this tool, you can manually identify and delete unused assets from your project. Here’s how you can reliably delete everything except your used assets:

### Step-by-Step: Deleting Unused Assets Using the Reference Viewer

#### 1. Use the Reference Viewer to Identify Used Assets

1. **Open Your Project** in Unreal Engine.
    
2. **Go to the Content Browser**.
    
3. **Right-click on Your Main Level(s)** or other key assets (like blueprints, game modes, or anything that references a lot of other assets) and choose **Reference Viewer**.
    
    * This will show you a network graph of all the assets that are being used by the selected level or asset.
    * The graph will show direct and indirect dependencies (e.g., materials, textures, meshes, etc.).
4. **Analyze the Reference Viewer**:
    
    * Any asset not connected to your level or main assets (like blueprints or core gameplay elements) in this graph is unused and can be safely deleted.
    * Make a note of the used assets or keep the Reference Viewer open as you begin cleaning up the project.

#### 2. Filter and Delete Unused Assets

1. **Use the "Filter by Unused Assets" Option**:
    
    * In the **Content Browser**, click the **Filters** button (located at the top of the Content Browser).
    * Under **Other Filters**, select **Unused Assets**.
    * This will show all assets in your project that are not currently referenced by any of your levels or main gameplay elements.
2. **Delete the Unused Assets**:
    
    * Select all unused assets (filtered through the previous step) and delete them by right-clicking and choosing **Delete**.
    * Unreal will ask you to confirm, and this process should delete all assets that are not referenced in your project.

#### 3. Manually Check for Additional Unused Folders or Assets

1. **Go through the Content Browser**:
    
    * Manually inspect folders that might contain unused assets.
    * You can combine this with the **Reference Viewer** to check if certain assets in large asset packs are actually being used.
2. **Delete Unused Folders or Assets**:
    
    * After using the **Unused Assets** filter and **Reference Viewer**, you can also right-click on entire folders in the **Content Browser** and choose **Fix Up Redirectors** before deleting them. This ensures any asset redirects are cleaned up, and the assets are safely removed.

#### 4. Use the **Size Map** Tool (Optional)

To further identify large files that may be worth removing, you can use Unreal’s **Size Map** tool to see which assets are taking up the most space:

1. **Open the Content Browser**.
2. Right-click on the root **Content Folder** and choose **Asset Actions** > **Size Map**.
    * This will display a map showing the file sizes of different assets, making it easier to identify which large assets can be removed.
3. Combine this with the **Reference Viewer** to check if large assets are unused and can be deleted.

#### 5. Test Your Project After Cleanup

1. **Test the Project** after removing unused assets to ensure everything still works correctly.
2. Open each level and playtest to ensure no necessary assets were accidentally removed.

#### 6. Final Cleanup

1. **Fix Up Redirectors**:
    * Right-click the **Content** folder in the **Content Browser** and select **Fix Up Redirectors in Folder**. This ensures that any references or redirects to deleted assets are cleaned up.
2. **Save and Backup**:
    * Save your project and consider making a backup before finalizing the cleanup process.

### Summary:

* Use the **Reference Viewer** to identify assets connected to your key gameplay elements (like levels and blueprints).
* Use **Filter by Unused Assets** to find assets that are not referenced anywhere in your project.
* Use **Size Map** to identify large assets and delete unused ones.
* After cleanup, use **Fix Up Redirectors** to ensure the project is tidy.

This process will allow you to reliably delete everything except the assets actively used in your project. Let me know if you need more help with this or have any further questions!

**You:**

i cant use the size map tool because there is no asset actions option when I right click on the content folder

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If you're unable to access the **Size Map** tool through **Asset Actions** when right-clicking the **Content Folder**, it's possible that the option is missing due to the way you're interacting with the folder. Here's an alternative approach to find the **Size Map** tool and address the issue:

### Alternative Way to Access the **Size Map** Tool

1. **Open the Content Browser**:
    
    * Make sure you have the **Content Browser** open and visible.
2. **Locate the Folder You Want to Analyze**:
    
    * Instead of right-clicking on the **Content Folder** itself, try selecting a subfolder or individual assets within your **Content** folder.
3. **Access the Size Map Tool via the Top Menu**:
    
    * If you don’t see the **Asset Actions** when you right-click, try using the top menu.
    * Go to **Window** > **Developer Tools** > **Size Map**. This should open the **Size Map** window.

### Using the Size Map

Once you open the **Size Map**, you can:

1. **Analyze the Entire Project**:
    * It will automatically show you the largest assets across your entire project, sorted by size.
2. **Inspect Specific Folders**:
    * You can expand specific folders and inspect their contents to see which assets are taking up the most space.

### Additional Tips

If you still can't access **Size Map** and want another way to reduce size or inspect large assets:

#### 1. **Check Folder Sizes Manually in File Explorer**

* **Go to your Project Folder**: Navigate to your Unreal project’s root directory on your system.
* **Sort by Size**: Open the **Content** folder and manually sort files by size to see which ones are the largest.
    * Large textures, models, or asset packs will usually stand out here.

#### 2. **Use the Filter in Content Browser**

In Unreal Engine's **Content Browser**:

1. **Click Filters** at the top of the **Content Browser**.
2. **Select Large Assets** under **Size Filters**.
    * This will filter out and display the largest assets in your project.

This method can help identify large assets and narrow down which are taking up space without needing the **Size Map** tool directly.

Let me know if this method works or if you still run into issues with accessing the tool!

**You:**

okay I got the project down from 20GB to 800MB. However this is still too large, but most of it, 500MB, is in the starter content textures folder. How do I get this all uploaded to github now?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great work on reducing the size of your project! Now that you're down to 800MB and most of it is in the **Starter Content Textures** folder, you have a couple of options to upload your project to GitHub:

### Option 1: Exclude Starter Content from Git and Document It

If your grader doesn’t specifically need the starter content (which Unreal Engine can regenerate), you can exclude it from the Git repository and document that the project requires the starter content.

#### Steps to Exclude Starter Content Textures from Git:

1. **Update Your `.gitignore` File**:
    
    * Add the following line to your `.gitignore` to exclude the starter content:
    
    ```plaintext
    Content/StarterContent/
    ```
    
2. **Document Starter Content Requirement**:
    
    * In the root of your project, create a `README.md` file.
    * In the `README.md`, add instructions stating that the grader will need to enable **Starter Content** when opening the project in Unreal Engine.
    
    Example:
    
    ```markdown
    # Unreal Engine Project
    
    This project requires Unreal Engine's **Starter Content**. If the textures or assets are missing, enable **Starter Content** in Unreal Engine.
    ```
    
3. **Test Without the Starter Content**:
    
    * Before committing, make sure the project still opens and runs properly without the Starter Content.
    * Unreal Engine should automatically regenerate the missing starter assets when the project is opened.

#### Upload the Reduced Project:

1. **Commit** the project after excluding the Starter Content in `.gitignore`.
2. **Push** the project to GitHub.

This method keeps your repository smaller and easier to manage.

* * *

### Option 2: Use Git LFS (Large File Storage)

If you need to include the **Starter Content** or other large files that are essential to the project, you can use **Git LFS** (Large File Storage), which allows you to store large binary files in GitHub.

#### Steps to Set Up Git LFS:

1. **Install Git LFS**:
    
    * If you haven’t installed Git LFS, you can download and install it from [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
2. **Track Large Files**:
    
    * In your project directory, run the following command to track all files in the **StarterContent/Textures** folder (or other large folders):
    
    ```bash
    git lfs track "Content/StarterContent/Textures/*"
    ```
    
    This will configure Git LFS to store large texture files using LFS instead of regular Git.
    
3. **Commit and Push the Project**:
    
    * After tracking the large files, commit your changes and push the project to GitHub.
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    git add .gitattributes
    git commit -m "Track large starter content textures using LFS"
    git push origin main
    ```
    
    Git LFS will handle large files separately, and your Git repository will stay smaller while still storing the large assets.
    

* * *

### Option 3: Use an External File Hosting Service

If GitHub’s limits are too restrictive and Git LFS isn’t feasible for you, you can upload large assets like the **Starter Content** to an external service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) and provide a link in your repository.

#### Steps to Use External Hosting:

1. **Upload the Starter Content to a Cloud Service**:
    
    * Zip the **Starter Content** folder and upload it to Google Drive or Dropbox.
2. **Add a Download Link in `README.md`**:
    
    * In your `README.md`, include a link to the zip file along with instructions to download and place the **Starter Content** in the project folder.
    
    Example:
    
    ```markdown
    # Unreal Engine Project
    
    This project requires the following Starter Content assets. Please download them from the following link and extract them to `Content/StarterContent/`:
    
    [Download Starter Content](https://drive.google.com/yourlink)
    ```
    

This method ensures you don’t exceed GitHub’s file size limits while still providing the necessary files for your grader.

* * *

### Summary:

* **Option 1**: Exclude the **Starter Content** using `.gitignore` and document the requirement in a `README.md` file.
* **Option 2**: Use **Git LFS** to handle large files like textures.
* **Option 3**: Host large assets on a cloud service and provide a download link in your `README.md`.

Let me know which option works best for you or if you need further assistance with any of the steps!

**You:**

im using guthub desktop so what is the process for editing my gitignore and pushing these changes to main

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If you're using GitHub Desktop, editing your `.gitignore` file and pushing the changes to the `main` branch is a straightforward process. Here's how you can do it step-by-step:

### Steps to Edit the `.gitignore` and Push Changes Using GitHub Desktop

#### 1. Locate and Edit the `.gitignore` File

1. **Open Your Project Folder**:
    
    * In GitHub Desktop, click on the **Repository** menu at the top and select **Show in Explorer** (Windows) or **Reveal in Finder** (Mac).
    * This will open your project folder.
2. **Find or Create the `.gitignore` File**:
    
    * Look for a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your project folder.
    * If it doesn’t exist, you can create one:
        * Right-click in the folder, select **New Text Document**, and name it `.gitignore` (make sure to remove any `.txt` extension).
3. **Edit the `.gitignore` File**:
    
    * Open the `.gitignore` file in a text editor (like Notepad or any code editor).
    * Add the following lines to exclude the **Starter Content** or other large folders you don’t want to upload:
    
    ```plaintext
    # Exclude Starter Content and other large files
    Content/StarterContent/
    ```
    
    * You can also add any other large folders you want to exclude.
4. **Save the `.gitignore` File**:
    
    * After making your changes, save the `.gitignore` file.

#### 2. Stage and Commit Changes in GitHub Desktop

1. **Return to GitHub Desktop**:
    
    * After saving the `.gitignore` file, return to GitHub Desktop.
    * You should see that GitHub Desktop has detected changes to the `.gitignore` file.
2. **Stage the Changes**:
    
    * In GitHub Desktop, you should see your `.gitignore` file under **Changes** on the left-hand side.
    * Make sure the checkbox next to the `.gitignore` file is selected (this stages the change for the commit).
3. **Write a Commit Message**:
    
    * In the bottom-left, you’ll see a text box labeled **Summary**. Type a short commit message like:
        * `"Add .gitignore to exclude Starter Content"`
4. **Commit to Main**:
    
    * Click the **Commit to main** button at the bottom to commit your changes.

#### 3. Push Changes to GitHub

1. **Push the Commit to GitHub**:
    * After committing, GitHub Desktop will show a **Push origin** button in the top toolbar (next to the current branch name).
    * Click **Push origin** to upload your changes to GitHub.

#### 4. Verify Changes on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub.com**:
    
    * After pushing the changes, you can go to your GitHub repository online and check that the `.gitignore` file is there and your large folders (like **Starter Content**) are no longer being tracked.
2. **Check the Repository Size**:
    
    * Verify that the size of your repository is reduced after excluding the unnecessary files.

### Additional Steps for Large Files (Optional)

If you decide to use **Git LFS** or another solution for handling large files:

1. Follow the steps to install and configure **Git LFS**.
2. After configuring Git LFS, you’ll stage, commit, and push changes using the same steps as outlined above for GitHub Desktop.

### Summary of Key Steps:

* **Edit the `.gitignore`** file to exclude large folders like `StarterContent`.
* **Commit** the changes in GitHub Desktop.
* **Push** the changes to the `main` branch.

**You:**

well what if i want to push it all to guthub, just in small pieces under 100mb?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If you want to push your Unreal Engine project to GitHub in smaller pieces (keeping each commit under GitHub’s 100MB file size limit), you can follow a process of selectively committing and pushing parts of your project. Here’s how to do that using GitHub Desktop:

### Steps to Push Large Projects in Smaller Pieces to GitHub

#### 1. Identify and Group Files into Smaller Pieces

To stay under GitHub’s 100MB limit, you can group your files into smaller batches that each total under 100MB. You will commit and push each batch separately.

1. **Open Your Project in Explorer/Finder**:
    
    * In GitHub Desktop, click on **Repository** > **Show in Explorer/Finder** to open your project folder.
2. **Sort by File Size**:
    
    * In Explorer/Finder, sort the files by size so you can identify large assets that might push your repository size above 100MB.
    * Start by focusing on smaller assets or folders that don’t exceed 100MB.
3. **Move Larger Files Temporarily**:
    
    * If you have large files (like textures or models) that exceed 100MB, temporarily move them out of the project folder to a backup folder.
    * This will allow you to commit the remaining smaller files first.

#### 2. Stage, Commit, and Push the First Batch of Files

Now that you have smaller file batches to work with, you can start committing them:

1. **Stage the First Batch of Files**:
    
    * Open **GitHub Desktop**, and under **Changes**, select a group of files that are under 100MB in total.
    * Make sure the files you want to commit are checked, and the large files (which are over 100MB) are unchecked.
2. **Commit the Files**:
    
    * Write a commit message in the **Summary** box (e.g., `"Initial Commit: Basic Project Files"`).
    * Click **Commit to main**.
3. **Push the Commit**:
    
    * Once the files are committed, click **Push origin** in the top-right corner to upload the changes to GitHub.

#### 3. Gradually Reintroduce Larger Files in Small Batches

Now you can start adding larger assets back into the project in small, manageable chunks.

1. **Move Larger Files Back into the Project**:
    
    * Take a subset of large files (e.g., textures, models, etc.) and move them back into the project folder in chunks that total under 100MB.
2. **Stage, Commit, and Push Each Batch**:
    
    * Repeat the process of staging, committing, and pushing these files in small batches, ensuring that each batch is under the 100MB limit.
3. **Monitor the Repository Size**:
    
    * Keep an eye on GitHub’s repository size as you push the pieces. Make sure you don’t exceed any limits for individual file sizes or total repo size.

#### 4. Use Git LFS for Large Individual Files (Optional)

If some of your assets are too large to split up (e.g., textures or models over 100MB), you can use **Git LFS (Large File Storage)** to handle these files:

1. **Install Git LFS**:
    
    * Install Git LFS from [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
2. **Track Large Files with Git LFS**:
    
    * In GitHub Desktop, open the terminal by clicking **Repository** > **Open in Terminal** (or use a regular terminal in your project folder).
    * Run the following command to track large files:
    
    ```bash
    git lfs track "*.png"  # Example for large textures
    git lfs track "Content/StarterContent/Textures/*"  # Example for large texture folder
    ```
    
3. **Commit and Push Large Files Using LFS**:
    
    * After setting up LFS tracking, commit and push the large files as normal using GitHub Desktop.

#### 5. Clean Up and Push Remaining Files

Once you have committed and pushed all pieces of the project, you can:

1. **Move Back All Remaining Files**:
    * Return any remaining files (if any) into the project directory.
2. **Finalize the Commit**:
    * Stage and commit any remaining small files, and push them to GitHub.

### Summary:

* **Identify smaller batches** of files (under 100MB) to commit and push incrementally.
* **Move large files** temporarily to avoid exceeding the limit.
* Use **Git LFS** for any large individual files (if needed).
* **Commit and push** files in batches until the full project is uploaded.

This method allows you to stay within GitHub’s 100MB per-file limit while gradually pushing all your project files.
